MovieList is an app where the user can see an initial list of the
top 20 movies. The user can scroll through this list of movies as
well as add movies, and an option to save. The add option sends the
user to a second activity where there are four EditTexts to enter the
details of the movie and then a button to submit it. The user can
also use the a swipe right action to remove any movie from the list.
